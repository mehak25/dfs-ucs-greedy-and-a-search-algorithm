In this programming homework, you will be working on the classic pancake problem that was
discussed in the class. You need to write a program that receives an arbitrary order of 4
pancakes from the user plus the type of the search algorithm, and prints the steps that the
specified algorithm needs to take to reach to the goal state.

Input
The input should consist of four-digit and one character (####X), where the first digit indicates
the ID of the bottom pancake, second indicates the second lowest, etc. Figure 1 shows the fourdigit
representation of the left pancake-set on the right. The last character would be any of “d”,
“u”, “g” and “a” characters, which refer to the Depth-First (DFS), Uniform-Cost (UCS), Greedy
and A* search algorithms respectively.

1. Implements dfs, ucs, greedy and a* search algorithm
2. It takes input as described in homework - 2413d, 2413u, 2413g, 2413a
3. Run it in command line using python3 GuptaM.py
4. If it asks you to install PTable, use below command
		pip3 install PTable
